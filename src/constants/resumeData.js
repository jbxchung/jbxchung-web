            My name is Jiehong Brandon Xavier Chung, but I go by Brandon. Currently I am working in the financial technology space, 
            developing enterprise web applications and automating trade workflows.

            In my free time, I have a few interests - from tinkering with electronics, to cooking all sorts of foods from different regions
            around the world, to playing the piano and violin. As for physical activities, I also enjoy hiking, table tennis, and Taekwondo.
